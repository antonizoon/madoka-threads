==== Revolution ====

With no memories of herself and her past life, Faust, the main protagonist /a/ controls, wakes up one day, only to find herself in the Madokaverse trapped in Madoka's body. Possessing nothing but the knowledge of the events of the anime, Faust decides to make it her life mission to save this timeline and the girls without resorting to using the anime wish.

After making contact with Madoka's mind, Faust vaguely remembers a bit of her past and herself. She once lived in a world where everyone had some sort of superpower, such as shooting fire or the ability to fly. Faust herself was looked down upon, made fun of, and excluded from everything, because she had what everyone thought a very useless power. Unlike anyone else, Faust has 1000 different minds or "voices" in her head that help guide her in making decisions. But since her power doesn't have any sort of practical use, Faust felt she was useless. One night, Faust dreamed that she wanted to make a difference in the world, when then suddenly a bright light engulfed her, beginning her journey. Faust then realized that she also had the power to leap into other people's minds. Faust's desire to make a difference, and Madoka being the center of everything in the Madokaverse, is what caused her to be trapped in Madoka's body. As Faust continues to fight to save the girls, her personality changes to be more similar to Madoka. The way Faust talked, her kindness to the other girls, her goals and desires, all became more and more similar to Madoka the longer Faust spent time in Madoka's body. This culminates in a dream sequence, where Faust and Madoka eventually come to terms to fully accepting each other, and agreeing that the both of them can change the future. This causes their minds to fully merge into one complete being.

Throughout Revolution, Faust's mind powers slowly developed and became more powerful. She learned to use Mind Bombs, in which she shoots an invisible dome of powerful force from her mind. Using her mind powers however cause her head trauma, potentially damaging her body permanently. Continued use of her powers however lessened the strain on her body. Faust's mind powers grew so powerful to the point that she was able to break causality, bringing TL3 Mami, Kyouko, Madoka, and Homura for the fight against Walpurgisnact, and merging all existing timelines into one. Faust was even able to entirely erase Walpurgisnacht from existence with just her mind. Faust reached the peak of her powers when she was able to access the powers of Madoka, Homura, Mami, Kyouko, and Sayaka without contracting in the battle against Ferocia, the witch of causality. The combination of those powers allowed her to defeat Ferocia and seemingly save the world. After Faust returns from the battle with Ferocia, Faust and Madoka's minds separate, with Faust also acquiring a body of her own in the form of Madoka's Goddess alter-ego. Despite the separation, Faust still maintains a similar personality and a small, weak connection to Madoka.

==== Covenant and Sketch (Alternate Universe) ====
In Covenant, it is discovered that Faust and Anbey are enemies destined to fight each other to the death. Faust is the embodiment of Order and Hope while Anbey is the embodiment of Chaos and Despair. Their actions throughout their respective stories influenced each other, giving them godlike powers. 

In Sketch, it is then revealed that Faust and Anbey are siblings and that Ouroboros, a god who's been pulling the entire events of Magia behind the scenes, is their father. Not knowing the purpose of his existence, Ouroboros became interested in humanity and wished to know how to love, feel, and live like a human. Despite watching humanity for many, many years, Ouroboros could still not understand them, and why they suffer so much. Because he has no one to relate or share his own thoughts and feelings, Ouroboros created his two sons, Faust and Anbey, with his own power. Ouroboros watched his two sons grow and saw that they would always share everything with each other, whether they laughed, smiled, or cried. He saw his own two sons fall in love with each other. Ouroboros wondered why his own two sons can experience love, yet he cannot. Ouroboros then grew jealous of his two sons and decided to punish them. He wanted his sons to feel his own pain. He pitted Faust and Anbey against each other as eternal enemies, with Faust representing Ouroboro's positive emotions, while Anbey represented his negative emotions. Ouroboros watched them fight and suffer, and reveled in it. Ouroboros saw their pain and suffering as entertainment, and repeated their eternal struggle endlessly. Ouroboros had control over everything. He could choose the universe, genders for Faust and Anbey, anything. The endless cycle was a game to him and he had control over every factor. Ouroboro's control over the cycles also means that Faust's memories of the world he once lived in is fake and was fabricated by Ouroboros himself. Although the seeds of power instilled in Faust and Anbey were out of Ouroboro's control, in the off-chance that Faust and Anbey gain enough power to combat Ouroboros and defeat him, the seeds would give birth to a new Ouroboros. Even though Faust and Anbey fought each other endlessly and suffered, Ouroboros noticed that they always fell in love with each other, regardless of anything. Despite the pain, fighting, and suffering, Faust and Anbey's eternal love for each other never fades away.

==== Rebuild ====

In the beginning of Rebuild, Faust attends Mitakihara Middle School with the other girls, when suddenly her golden eyes changed color into blood red. Her blood-red eyes seemingly detecting a witch, Faust runs outside the school to discover a different type of witch, an Infernal. Faust immediately realizes the distortions she created within the Madokaverse gave birth to the Infernal Witches. So far throughout Rebuild, Faust's inability to do anything along with her frustration over Homura causes her to have disturbing illusions of the girls dying. The illusions gets bad to the point where she vomits and blacks out, being bedded once again at Mami's place.

After recovering from her sickness and gaining a new ability, Faust heads out with Kyouko and Yuma to hunt Ayase Souju. Although Kyouko and Yuma seemed to be more than a match for Ayase, her dual personality catches Kyouko and Yuma off-guard and she manages to knockout the both of them. As Ayase was ready to kill the three girls, Kirika makes her appearance out of nowhere and kills Ayase. With Kirika also came Oriko. Oriko, remembering what Faust promised her back in Revolution before her death, asks Faust if she will not contract and if she will help her change the future. Although completely caught off-guard at Oriko's proposal, Faust accepts it and decides to work together with her. Oriko then says that in order to save this world, both Sayaka and Madoka must be killed.

As part of Revolution's ending has been changed for Rebuild, there's a little difference in Faust's abilities. After the battle with Ferocia, Faust loses the ability to access the other girl's powers and also loses her ability to use Mind Bombs. This may be because of the amount of power Faust used to erase Walpurgisnacht and defeat Ferocia was significant. Her power loss has reverted her to be more like how she was at the beginning of Revolution. Faust however has access to some new abilities she previously didn't use in Revolution. Along with her Mind Leap ability, Faust also the power to mess with people's minds, known as Mind Tamper. This ability hasn't been used as of now and it's limits aren't exactly known yet. Faust can also use Mind Field, which allows her to scan her surroundings. As mentioned before, Faust also has the ability to detect Infernal Witches, which is visibly shown when her eyes change color into blood red. While resting in Mami's place, recovering from a fever, Faust starts experiences illusions again, but this time she tries to take control of it. Doing so granted her another ability, Mind Projection, which allows her to see through another person's mind and even manipulate it, sort of like an upgraded Mind Leap along with Mind Tamper, except her mind doesn't leave her own body. Like in Revolution, Faust's mind powers still cause damage to her own body, limiting her power's overall usefulness.

However, after finding herself stranded in Asunaro City (City in Kazumi Magica), Faust once again dreams of Starcrossed Place, and meets a girl who strangely resembles Sketch Anbey. The girl then grants Faust new powers, in exchange for losing her mind powers. Faust manages to keep Mind Field and Mind Read, however, they no longer cause strain on her body. The new powers also gave Faust confidence in herself, being less spineless and way more swag. Faust now also has a habit of shouting OBJECTION and HOLD IT like Phoenix Wright. 

In episode 12, it is revealed that Anbey is the one who granted Faust her new powers and that she is actually a "cultivated" puella magi. What that means isn't exactly known but Anbey mentions that Faust is her "prized tree" among her farm (energy). Faust is probably also the only magical girl to have many different abilities that are gained and strengthened by the bonds she shares with her friends. Faust's uniqueness as a Puella Magi has also captured the interest of Kyubey and Jubey. What they plan to do is unknown.

In episode 13, as Faust hangs out with Kazumi, Kaoru, and Umika, she opens up to them, talking to them about her past. It is then revealed that Faust is inflicted with memory loss, and can only retain her memories for a couple of days. In order for her to remember, Faust each night writes in a [http://pastebin.com/niZyEYQV journal] off-screen and reads its contents, desperately trying to maintain her fading memories. Her memory loss stems from the constant use of her mind powers back in Revolution. Her mind wasn't able to take all the stress that comes with her powers, and inflicted permanent damage into her brain, giving her severe memory loss.

Faust's PM form is revealed in her first fight against the Infernal that attacked her and the other girls the other night. Her outfit is similar to Archer from Fate/Stay Night and Dante from Devil May Cry. She wears a long, red and black longcoat, covering her shoulders and arms. Black armor covers her upper body while a black, long skirt falls over her knees. A belt is used to keep her outfit in place, and brown, leather boots are used as her footwear. Along with her Social Link Powers, Faust also wields two swords as her default weapons, the Dreadmoon, a broad sword with jagged black edges, and Veritas Luna (Will Sword), a long, sleek silver blade with runic engravings. As a Puella Magi, Faust of course also has much faster speed and strength than a normal human. 

One of Faust's ultimate moves, the Reality Marble or Pseudo-Witch Barrier, is revealed during her fight with Tamiko. It acts exactly like Nasu's Reality Marbles, and it allows Faust to spam any of her abilities with no MP cost. The barrier itself however takes a plethora of MP to create.

During Episode 16, when Faust stays at Madoka's place for the night, Faust reads her twin sister's own journal, discovering that despite everything she and Homura has said to Madoka, she remains the same as she ever was, feeling useless not being able to help, and wishing to form a contract in order to do so. While taking a bath together with Madoka, the short-pink haired girl embraces Faust in tears, revealing her feelings about her own uselessness. Faust tells Madoka that she will do everything in Madoka's stead, and reveals about her memory loss and her theory that she will disappear once her memories fade entirely. Faust assures Madoka that she won't disappear until she knows she made the world a better place for everyone, but Madoka can't help but cry, not wanting the twin sister she loved to disappear. Madoka asks what she can do, to which Faust replies that just living and breathing is enough for her and everyone else. Madoka, realizing Faust's words, thanks Faust, their Social Link maxed.  

While heading to Sayaka's place before the festival starts, Faust comes across Anbey again, to which she ask's the Incubator more information. The black Incubator reveals information that contradicts previous info and makes it seem like Faust is just a play thing in Anbey's hands. Anbey then says that the Social Link Abilities use actually draw magic from the girls she has bonded with, corrupting their Soul Gems. To those who don't have Soul Gems (Madoka and Sayaka), Faust is actually draining their life force, slowly killing them. This reveal makes Faust lose it, as she goes into an uncontrolled Rage Mode. Her bloodlust leads to her impaling Yuma, and she fights Kyouko and Mami, although she is outmatched, her Reality Marble not working, and the two veteran magical girls being far more experienced than her. Mami binds Faust, and the pink-haired girl, her senses restored back to normal, confesses into giving into her anger because of Anbey, and tells the two girls to kill her. Despite everything, Yuma who healed herself from Faust's attack, forgives Faust, knowing that deep down, she is a good person. Mami and Kyouko let Faust go, at the cost of Faust temporarily breaking her Social Links with the two girls. Mami and Kyouko however make up with Faust during the festival, the two girls quickly forgiving the pink-haired girl despite her actions.

Upon witnessing Madoka and Homura being killed by Ayume, Faust rewinds time and prevents that event, and fights Ayume. Although Ayume is a cultivated Puella Magi just like Faust, with the help of Homura, Faust easily defeats and kills her. The fight however drained Faust much of her magic, and made her realize that she will disappear shortly. Faust then spends some time with the other girls, before she notices that Oriko and Madoka, who've gone to Mami's apartment to retrieve Faust's journal, have been missing for quite awhile. She tracks the two down trapped in a Witch's barrier, rescues them, and defeats the Witch. The fight however strained her once more, her body about to disappear. Before the inevitable happens, Anbey shows up to talk to Faust one last time, till suddenly, Faust uses the Team Mimic ability on Anbey and seemingly manages to regenerate her body, avoiding her death. However, this was revealed to be an illusion Faust see's in her own barrier, the long pink-haired girl already turning into a witch. She takes one last journey to Starcrossed Place in which she speaks to an unknown voice asking about Faust's motivations. She then finally breaks down in grief, her Soul Gem bursting into a Grief Seed and giving birth to the Witch of Infinity. Although the Faust the girls know is dead, Anbey and Kyubey reveal that Madoka contains a 2nd soul in her body, the soul of Faust. At the end of Revolution, when Faust separated from Madoka, while the majority of Faust's soul was contained in her new body, a small portion of it was still inside Madoka, establishing the connection between them. Upon learning this, Madoka decides to confront Faust's witch.

==== Vapor Tale ====
<div style="border: 1px solid #989898; padding:8px 10px; margin-bottom: 1em; background: #F6F6F6;"> '''Note:''' Faust in Vapor Tale is a cameo appearance and is not canon with the main storyline. However, it can be considered canon within the Sketch universe.</div>

Faust makes her appearance in Almond the Bronze City where Blake and the others stop by for an arena tourney Blake wants to participate in. She meets Blake in the waiting room and easily become friends. After the drawing, they end up becoming each other's first opponents. Faust and Blake have an amazing fight, with the match ending in Blake's victory due to him having much more experience with fighting.

It's revealed that when Faust and Anbey clashed in TL5, their fight created even more distortions that accidentally then plunged them into the world of Vapor Tale. Anbey still manages to defeat Faust however, and steals her seed of power. Although Faust lost the seed, the Steam within the Vapor Tale world allowed her to regain her powers, although weakened. Hearing someone that resembles Anbey was attending the arena tourney in Almond, Faust decided to participate in hopes of finding the Incubator girl, reclaiming her seed, and to bring an end to Ouroboros, her father.

=== Kaname Madoka ===

|[[File:Magia madoka.jpg|200px|right|]]

==== Revolution ====

The main protagonist of the anime and whose body Faust is in control of at the beginning of the story, Madoka herself at first doesn't appear in the story, her mind being unconsciously locked away by Faust. After a couple days in her body, Faust however manages to make contact and communicate with Madoka's mind. Faust tells Madoka who she is and and the whole truth about the events of the anime, and reassures her that she is here to help Madoka. Both of them then agree to share Madoka's body, with Faust being in control most of the time, with Madoka switching whenever its safe. Because Faust is the dominant mind in control, the amount of time Faust spends in Madoka's body affected Faust's personality, making her act more and more like Madoka. This is probably because Madoka's mind is unknowingly influencing Faust's own mind, and in turn her actions and personality. Madoka's influence on Faust culminates in a dream sequence in which the both of them fully accept each other for who they are and agree that they both have the power to change the future. This causes Madoka and Faust's minds to merge, creating one complete being. However, after the defeat of Ferocia, Faust and Madoka separate, with Faust acquiring her own body in the form of Madoka's Goddess alter-ego.  Despite the separation, Faust still maintains a similar personality and a small, weak connection to Madoka.

==== Sketch (Alternate Universe) ====

In Sketch, Madoka is revealed to be the Scale, the one who keeps the embodiment of Order (Faust) and Chaos (Anbey) in balance. The Scale is independent from Ouroboros and is only created when the balance between Faust and Anbey is broken. When Anbey steals Faust's seed of power and leaves her to die, stuck in the original TL5, Faust, remembering her connection with Madoka, tries to reach out to her. Madoka then summons Faust back to their own timeline, designating herself as the Scale.

==== Rebuild ====

With Madoka finally having control of her own body, she and the girls, along with their new friend Faust continue to live their lives normally until Infernal Witches appear to threaten their short-lived peace. Madoka doesn't realize that Homura seems to have some issues regarding Faust until Faust asks Madoka herself why Homura seems mad at her. Wanting to help Faust, she tries to remedy the situation between the two girls, only for Faust to become sick and black out shortly after.

After Faust agrees to work with Oriko and Kirika, the bucket-head then reveals her plan of killing both Madoka and Sayaka, most likely seeing a future where both of them destroy the world as Witches/Infernals.

Upon getting attacked and attempting to escape from an Infernal, a Puella Magi named Tamiko appears to kidnap Madoka and Sayaka. Although Faust manages to take control of the girl's mind, they still end up being taken to the kidnapper's headquarters, where Faust meets another magical girl named Ayume, and Anbey. Faust is knocked out and is left stranded in Asunaro City while Madoka and Sayaka are then tortured by Anbey's minions. Despite the intense pain and suffering the two girls go through, both resisted contracting and were eventually saved by Oriko.

During Episode 16, when Faust stays at Madoka's place for the night, Faust reads her twin sister's own journal, discovering that despite everything she and Homura has said to Madoka, she remains the same as she ever was, feeling useless not being able to help, and wishing to form a contract in order to do so. While taking a bath together with Madoka, the short-pink haired girl embraces Faust in tears, revealing her feelings about her own uselessness. Faust tells Madoka that she will do everything in Madoka's stead, and reveals about her memory loss and her theory that she will disappear once her memories fade entirely. Faust assures Madoka that she won't disappear until she knows she made the world a better place for everyone, but Madoka can't help but cry, not wanting the twin sister she loved to disappear. Madoka asks what she can do, to which Faust replies that just living and breathing is enough for her and everyone else. Madoka, realizing Faust's words, thanks Faust, their Social Link maxed.

After escaping Faust's barrier with the help of Homura, Madoka speaks to Anbey, wanting to learn his motivations and intentions. She then learns from both Anbey and Kyubey that her body contains a 2nd soul, the soul of Faust. When Faust separated from Madoka during Revolution, while most of her soul moved into her new body, a small portion of her soul remained in Madoka and established the connection between them. Upon learning this, Madoka decides to confront Faust's witch.

After leaving Hitomi to deal with Mami's witch, Candelero, along with Kyouko and Yuma, Madoka and Homura head to confront Faust's witch, but not before Madoka hears her own voice, but was not her's at the same time. Upon hearing the voice, she realizes what she has to do. They find the witch along with Oriko, Kirika, Kazumi, and Sayaka. The witch, formless and ever-changing in shape, wounds Sayaka, and kills Oriko and Kirika. Madoka rushes to save Kazumi and Sayaka, only to then use the power she inherited from Faust, and rewind time to the beginning of episode 22, when Faust just transformed into a Witch. Madoka then transforms, sporting Faust's Puella Magi outfit along with her powers, including Dreadmoon and Veritas Luna. She then combines the two swords into her signature bow, and heads off to save Mami before she turns into a witch, then confront Faust.

=== Anbey ===

{| width="100%"
|[[File:Magia anbey.jpg|250px|right|]]

==== Covenant and Sketch (Alternate Universe) ====

The main protagonist of Covenant, and a major character in Sketch, Anbey is an Incubator capable of emotions. Manipulative, sarcastic, vulgar, and egotistical, Anbey is interested more in her own personal gain than trying to save the universe from entropy. Intrigued and amused by the nature of humanity, Anbey decides to give humanity the ultimate test: by starting a war between 
humans and  magical girls. 

In Covenant, through a series of events, Anbey becomes trapped in Gretchen's (TL3 Madoka) barrier seemingly dying, only to wake up at Starcrossed Place, the place where Faust has her dreams. There Anbey and Faust meet for the first time and discover their relationship with each other. Both of them are enemies fated to fight each other to the death. All of Faust's actions in Revolution, and Anbey's actions in Covenant, reveal that Faust was the embodiment of Order and Hope, while Anbey was the embodiment of Chaos and Despair, and that they were affecting each other, giving themselves godly amounts of power. Both of them then clash, unleashing their powers, with Anbey possessing the powers of all the girls she contracted and also gaining a human form remarkably similar to Faust. While both are roughly equal in power, Anbey's meddling in Starcrossed Place along with Faust's sheer willpower results in Anbey's defeat. Anbey proclaims this isn't the end though, saying they will meet again and she will kill Faust. Anbey then manages to wake up  and escape from Gretchen's barrier, still in possession of the power she gained at Starcrossed Place, and furthers her plans for her world war and her confrontation with Faust.

In Sketch, it is then revealed that Faust and Anbey are siblings and that Ouroboros, a god who's been pulling the entire events of Magia behind the scenes, is their father. Not knowing the purpose of his existence, Ouroboros became interested in humanity and wished to know how to love, feel, and live like a human. Despite watching humanity for many, many years, Ouroboros could still not understand them, and why they suffer so much. Because he has no one to relate or share his own thoughts and feelings, Ouroboros created his two sons, Faust and Anbey, with his own power. Ouroboros watched his two sons grow and saw that they would always share everything with each other, whether they laughed, smiled, or cried. He saw his own two sons fall in love with each other. Ouroboros wondered why his own two sons can experience love, yet he cannot. Ouroboros then grew jealous of his two sons and decided to punish them. He wanted his sons to feel his own pain. He pitted Faust and Anbey against each other as eternal enemies, with Faust representing Ouroboro's positive emotions, while Anbey represented his negative emotions. Ouroboros watched them fight and suffer, and reveled in it. Ouroboros saw their pain and suffering as entertainment, and repeated their eternal struggle endlessly. Ouroboros had control over everything. He could choose the universe, genders for Faust and Anbey, anything. The endless cycle was a game to him and he had control over every factor. Although the seeds of power instilled in Faust and Anbey were out of Ouroboro's contro, in the off-chance that Faust and Anbey would gain enough power to combat and defeat him, the seeds would give birth to a new Ouroboros. Even though Faust and Anbey fought each other endlessly and suffered, Ouroboros noticed that they always fell in love with each other, regardless of anything. Despite the pain, fighting, and suffering, Faust and Anbey's eternal love for each other never fades away.

==== Rebuild ====

Anbey makes his reappearance in her Incubator form at the end of episode 4. It is unknown what is Anbey's current motivations or plans, other than she has an interest with two girls with great magical potential, presumably Faust and Madoka. Is is then revealed Anbey plans to contract Madoka and Sayaka. Anbey also brought two magical girls that work with him, Tamiko and Ayume. Tamiko attempts to capture Madoka and Sayaka, injuring Faust. Faust however manages to use Mind Projection on her, and orders her to take them to a safe place. Faust didn't think things through however, and they end up in Tamiko's apartment, where Ayume and Anbey also are. Faust is then knocked out and stranded in Asunaro City. In episode 12, it is revealed that Anbey is the one who granted Faust's new powers and that she actually contracted Faust as a "cultivated" puella magi, calling Faust her "prized tree" among her farm (energy). 

As an Incubator with emotions, Anbey is perfectly capable of lying, although it's very hard for Faust to tell the difference between his truth and lies. Anbey's words tend to contradict each other. One point, Anbey tells Faust that the Freezer and Kazumi will be the host of the Walpurgisnacht. At another point, he then tells Faust that Ayume is actually the host of Walpurgisnacht. Anbey uses this to his advantage, making Faust go into an uncontrolled Rage Mode that nearly kills Yuma when he reveals that Faust is draining the magic and lifeforce of the other girls through her abilities. Despite his very evil and manipulative exterior, at one point, Anbey show's a very different side of himself to Faust, saying how nothing can stop Faust, and he finds the human race amazing because of their soul and spirit. Whether this side of Anbey is genuine, or is just another way to confuse Faust, is not entirely certain. After Faust easily defeats Ayume, Faust figures out that Anbey is trying to overthrow his own race, by destroying all forms of life, their sources of energy, with Faust being the catalyst to his plan.

=== Akemi Homura ===
{| width="100%"
|[[File:Magia homura.jpg|200px|right|]]

==== Revolution ====

The initial target of Faust's affection, Faust decides to tell Homura the truth as Madoka after the initial confrontation between Mami and Homura in the first episode of Revolution. Believing in Faust, Homura becomes renewed with hope, and decides to do anything for Faust, with becoming friends and cooperating with Mami as the first step.

It is quite apparent that Faust is in love with Homura throughout Revolution, making quite a few advances, spending as much quality time with her, and even desperately trying to preserve Homura's Soul Gem after her body gets brutally scissored by a familiar. Although Homura doesn't realize this throughout Revolution, she finally does learn of Faust after Faust and Madoka separate from returning from the battle against Ferocia. Knowing that Faust is the one that saved her and the others and changed their future, she thanks Faust for everything and in a moment of weakness, is about to give herself to Faust, still thinking Faust is Madoka. Faust ultimately rejects her own feelings for Homura and gives her to Madoka, saying that she isn't Madoka and that the one person Homura loves, the one person she always protected, the one person she should be with, is Madoka. Homura realizes that Faust is right, and goes to Madoka to confess her feelings.

==== Sketch (Alternate Universe) ====

Even after Homura and Madoka got together in Sketch, Faust still shows signs of feelings for Homura. This is apparent when human Oktavia kills Homura, blaming her for the death of Mami in her timeline. Homura's death made Faust become fueled with immense rage, almost killing Oktavia, if not for Madoka about to make a contract with Kyubey to revive Homura. Faust stops Madoka from contracting, and in her place, uses all her power to save Homura, sacrificing her own life. It is implied that Homura may also have harboring feelings for Faust. Upon reviving and discovering that Faust sacrificed her own life for her, Homura also becomes consumed by rage and brutally kills Oktavia off-screen. After Faust is revived by the actions of Anbey, Faust decides to see the black-haired girl. Homura, who's still torn and confused by Faust's sacrifice, asks her why she saved her. Once again, Faust rejects her own feelings, and tells Homura that she loves her as her friend, and that she loves all the other girls too, and would do the same for the others.

==== Rebuild ====

Despite Walpurgisnacht and Ferocia being defeated at the end of Revolution, Homura isolates herself from the other girls except Madoka. She especially seems distant towards Faust. When Faust asked Homura why she is doing this, she replies rather coldly that she has her reasons and tells Faust to leave her alone. Faust figures Homura has some sort of issue with her, although she hasn't been able to figure out what or why. The tension between Faust and Homura gets worse after Faust discovers the Infernal Witches. Homura becomes even more frustrated with Faust, immediately figuring out that she is the source of the Infernal Witches. Faust again tries to find out why Homura is so angry with her, but Homura's stubborness cause Faust to give up in angry frustration. Despite everything Faust has done for her and the others, she couldn't understand why Homura is treating her this way. Although Madoka tries to remedy the situation, Faust becomes sick, seeing illusions of the girls dying, throws up and blacks out.   

People speculate Homura's frustration with Faust may have something to do with Faust previously controlling Madoka's body. It could be that Homura figured out that the Madoka who made advances on her and spent time with was actually Faust. She could be frustrated that Faust used Madoka's body as a way to get closer to her. Another side of the speculation is that Homura may actually have feelings for Faust and is conflicted over Faust and Madoka. Because Faust is extremely similar to Madoka in every way, and is the one person who freed her from her endless loop and saved Madoka, Homura may have fallen for Faust, despite also loving Madoka. She may be in denial for her feelings for Faust, and as a way to cope with it, she isolates herself from the other girls except Madoka, and pushes herself away from Faust. 

After returning from Asunaro City and checking up on Madoka and Sayaka's well being, Faust confronts Homura one more time. The raven-haired girl finally reveals her true feelings, believing that Faust has ruined everything because of her abnormality and power. She notes how Faust's presence has changed the Puella Magi system for the worse, and how she thinks she'll fail from saving Madoka once more. Even if Homura manages to finally save Madoka, she questions what will she do then. Homura then starts to despair, only to be saved by Faust once again. Faust tells Homura that if she's already given up, then she's even weaker than Faust is. Faust notes how much she has suffered throughout her story, yet nothing can compare to Homura's suffering, and asks Homura how would Madoka feel about that. The black-haired girl realizes the truth in Faust's words, and thanks the long pink-haired girl with a smile, their relationship patched.

==== Revolution ====

After her initial confrontation with Homura, Mami becomes friends and cooperates with Homura by Faust's request. After Faust and Sayaka visit Kyousuke in the hospital, they find a Grief Seed about to hatch right outside the hospital, just like episode 3 in the anime. Faust, knowing Mami died during her fight with Charlotte in the anime, decides to contact Homura instead of Mami, preventing Mami's initial death.

Throughout Revolution, Mami maintains her older sister type role like she did in the anime. After becoming friends with Homura, Mami's apartment is often the place where Faust and the girls make their plans for the future. After the tragic death of Kyouko, Mami decides to continue fighting in Kyouko's place and becomes Yuma's new caretaker. When Faust went to Sakura Church to check on Yuma a few days before Walpurgisnacht, Yuma gets brutally impaled by a powered-up Elsa Maria, seemingly dying. Mami, who was also in the area, becomes enraged and is the first person to activate Rage mode. With it, Mami decimates Elsa Maria with a super-powered Tiro Finale. Yuma, who's Soul Gem was still intact, was still alive, and she tells Mami not to worry, for she's still here. With Yuma still alive, Mami deactivates her Rage mode, and she takes her back home.

The day of Walpurgisnacht, Mami and Yuma visit the Sakura Church once more, before the final battle. There they find what seemingly is the spirit of Kyouko in physical form. Mami and Yuma are shocked, their friend seemingly alive again. Kyouko thanks Mami for taking care of Yuma all this time and embraces the both of them, only to then reveal she is a witch imitating Kyouko's form. The witch then impales the both of them with her tendrils. Mami, fueled with rage again, transforms into her MG form, only for her head to be quickly decapitated and crushed by the witch, sealing her death. 

Yuma is able to defeat the witch with her Rage form activated, but Mami was dead for good, never to be seen again until Faust managed to do the unthinkable, break causality. After defeating the Oktavia of another timeline, Faust and the girls find themselves in TL3 of the anime. They end up witnessing the scene in which Mami is about to kill Kyouko and Homura, only to be killed by Madoka. Faust decides to intervene and successfully stops Mami from killing Kyouko. After convincing Mami that everything will be alright, Faust decides to return to her original timeline, only for Kyouko to intervene and say she's coming too. The rest of the TL3 girls decide that they will also accompany Faust and her friends to help her defeat Walpurgisnacht. As Faust concentrates in transporting them back into her own world, Faust merges all existing timelines into her own, giving TL3 Mami and Kyouko the memories of Faust's timeline. After Faust returns from her battle with Ferocia and acquires her own body, Faust asks Mami if she can stay at her apartment since she has no home, with Mami being delighted at the idea of having company.

==== Sketch (Alternate Universe) ====

In Sketch, Mami is Faust's roommate and the two seemed to have developed an attraction towards each other. In the first episode, Faust and Mami take a bath together. As Mami cleans up Faust with a sponge, Faust couldn't resist letting out a moan of pleasure. Mami hugs Faust, thanking her for everything she's done for them. Faust then returns the hug with a kiss, that Mami passionately accepts. The kiss might have turned into something more, if Faust didn't slip in the bath tub, smashing her head and giving herself a minor concussion. Although Mami and Faust are much closer friends in Sketch and spend more time together, it is still uncertain if Faust and Mami actually harbor romantic feelings towards each other.

==== Rebuild ====

Mami plays a similar role as she did in Sketch. She is still Faust's roommate and the two still seem to be attracted to each other (Faust comments its probably because of Mami's mammies). Although they don't share any romantic kisses as of now, Mami has shown to be most concerned about Faust's well-being. When Faust faints from blood-loss from having her leg torn-off by an Infernal Witch, Mami immediately hugs Faust when she re-awakens at the nurse's office. She suggests that Faust stay back at her apartment for the day and get some rest. Although she follows Mami's suggestion at first, Faust decides to go out and watch a movie. This lands her in another dangerous situation as Faust gets trapped in a witch's barrier. Faust almost gets killed again, until Mami shows up at the last second and saves her. When Faust blacks out after her argument with Homura, Faust wakes up back in Mami's apartment, and finds Mami by her side, who has been taking care of her ever since. Faust tells Mami how she is so frustrated with herself by her inability to do anything. Mami makes a joke about how she would have no one to talk to if Faust wasn't here anymore, and tells her that she shouldn't feel this way, giving Faust a kiss on the forehead. Faust realizes she's been hurting the others, not just herself, and apologizes to Mami. Mami tells her to get a good night's rest, with Faust silently thanking Mami for everything. 

Faust and Mami seemingly has been confirmed to have feelings for each other in episode 7. After the girls learn of Oriko and Kirika, and Faust reassures Sayaka that she will protect her, Mami approaches Faust and hugs her, being worried about everything Faust has went through. Faust then thinks how she loves all the girls, but especially Mami, and gives Mami a passionate kiss, much to the shock of the other girls.

In Episode 17, Faust ask's Mami's opinion of herself, to which Mami says that she's a close friend, and that they kissed. The blond reveals that while she would be ready to have a relationship with Faust, she can't go through it. Mami loves Faust, for keeping her company as her roommate, after being alone for so long. Because Mami knows Faust is going to disappear eventually someday, she doesn't want to be together with Faust. Despite that, she doesn't want Faust to disappear, the one person who's always been by her side. Faust assures her that even though she will vanish, she will live her life for the blond and all the other girls, because magical girls bring hope. Mami realizes Faust's words and embraces her, sorry for what she said and glad that she got to meet Faust.

=== Miki Sayaka ===
{| width="100%"
|[[File:Magia sayaka.jpg|200px|right|]]

==== Revolution ====
Knowing that Sayaka is one of the major factors why Homura fails to save the girls in every timeline when Madoka contracts, Faust prioritizes preventing Sayaka from becoming a magical girl. Because of this, Sayaka does not change much as a character throughout the Magia series.

In Revolution, Faust knows of Sayaka's desire to heal Kyousuke's hand in every timeline she contracts. To prevent Sayaka from contracting, Faust instead had Mami heal the injured boy's hand. During the Oriko and Kirika confrontation, Sayaka would have contracted with Kyubey in order to protect her friends were it not for Faust's intervention by temporarily mind leaping into her body. Later in the story, Faust fully explains the details of the Magical Girl System to Sayaka to inform her the dangers of making a contract with Kyubey. After learning of the truth, Sayaka matures and becomes a stronger individual. Sayaka later tells Faust that she will only contract if she feels it is absolutely necessary to do so.

==== Sketch (Alternate Universe) ====

In Sketch, Sayaka becomes very close friends with Kyouko and also became another one of Yuma's "mommies." Like in Revolution, Sayaka is a bystander.

==== Rebuild ====

Sayaka is still a normal girl in Rebuild, living her life with the rest of the girls until their temporary peace gets destroyed by the appearance of Infernal Witches. She seems to have become very friendly with Faust in Rebuild, often being the first one to greet her and strike a conversation. Like in previous seasons, Sayaka is still a bystander in Rebuild as of now.

After Faust agrees to work with Oriko and Kirika, the bucket-head reveals that she plans to kill Madoka and Sayaka as well, probably seeing a future in which both girls destroy the world as Witches/Infernals.

Upon getting attacked and attempting to escape from an Infernal, a Puella Magi named Tamiko appears to kidnap Madoka and Sayaka. Although Faust manages to take control of the girl's mind, they still end up being taken to the kidnapper's headquarters, where Faust meets another magical girl named Ayume, and Anbey. Faust is knocked out and is left stranded in Asunaro City while Madoka and Sayaka are then tortured by Anbey's minions. Despite the intense pain and suffering the two girls go through, both resisted contracting and were eventually saved by Oriko.

=== Sakura Kyouko ===
{| width="100%"
|[[File:Magia kyouko.jpg|200px|right|]]

==== Revolution ====

Kyouko makes her first appearance in episode 5 of Revolution along with Yuma, asking Mami if she heard about the magical girl killings. Faust also knows of the events of Oriko Magica and decides that all the girls should work together in hunting down Oriko and Kirika.

After Homura killed Kirika and the girls defeated Oriko, Kyouko decided to head deeper into the witch barrier finish off the blood witch. Upon the death of Oriko, Sayaka questions if the two girls really had to die. This almost led to Sayaka being contracted by Kyubey if it were not for Faust's intervention by temporarily mind leaping into her body. Despite barely preventing Sayaka from contracting, little did the girls know that letting Kyouko to handle the witch alone was a big mistake. A scream then is heard deep into the witch barrier. Faust and the girls track the source of the scream, worried about Kyouko, only to find her being impaled viciously by the blood witch, bursting her Soul Gem and ending her life.

Although Kyouko never makes a physical appearance for awhile after her quick, tragic death, she seemingly still has a presence throughout Revolution, particularly with Mami and Yuma. After Mami defeated Elsa Maria with her Rage mode, Faust asked her how did it feel, with Mami responding that she heard Kyouko's voice telling her to keep fighting and protect Yuma. Even after Mami dies at the hand of a witch imitating Kyouko, Yuma was also able to hear Kyouko's voice as she activated her Rage mode, saving her from turning completely mad.

Kyouko finally makes her physical reappearance after Faust does the unthinkable and breaks causality. After defeating the Oktavia of another timeline, Faust and the girls find themselves in TL3 of the anime. They end up witnessing the scene in which Mami is about to kill Kyouko and Homura, only to be killed by Madoka. Faust decides to intervene and successfully stops Mami from killing Kyouko. After convincing Mami that everything will be alright, Faust decides to return to her original timeline, only for Kyouko to intervene and say she's coming too. The rest of the TL3 girls decide that they will also accompany Faust and her friends to help her defeat Walpurgisnacht. As Faust concentrates in transporting them back into her own world, Faust merges all existing timelines into her own, giving TL3 Mami and Kyouko the memories of Faust's timeline.

==== Sketch (Alternate Universe, Harem is canon) ====

After the defeat of Ferocia, Kyouko and Yuma started living together with Sayaka in Sketch. Kyouko, along with Sayaka, becomes one of Yuma's "mommies." Kyouko is also said to have a harem, with every one of the girls being attracted to her in some degree. Sayaka is obviously romantically attracted to Kyouko and is together with her. Mami is Kyouko's old friend from the past and still greatly cares about her. Homura is tsundere for Kyouko because she's the sexiest and one of the only people she could trust to work with in past timelines. Madoka is attracted to Kyouko because her VA, Aoi Yuuki, loves Kyouko deeply and claims her as her waifu. Even Faust, who holds no romantic feelings towards Kyouko, think she's sexy as hell. The 999 voices in her head also agrees. Yuma is the only exception because Kyouko is her mommy. Kyouko's harem is probably a result of the rare Kyouko gland that only a few people possess. This gland is said to grant the ability to make anyone fall in love or become attracted to the person in possession of the gland.

==== Rebuild ====

After Faust recovers after the 2nd Witch attack, she along with Kyouko and Yuma decide to hunt for Ayase Souju, who has been hunting other magical girls for their Soul Gems. Although Kyouko and Yuma seemingly have the upper hand on Ayase, her dual Soul Gem personality catches them off-guard, knocking the both of them out. They are however saved by the appearance of Oriko and Kirika, who kill Ayase.

In episode 18, Faust goes into an uncontrolled Rage Mode because of Anbey's words and attacks Kyouko, Mami, and Yuma, impaling the small green-haired girl. Kyouko fights Faust head on, and despite Faust's vast array of powers, still manages to hold her own and even wound Faust. Faust is binded my Mami, and Kyouko ask's why the pink-haired girl attacked them, to which she says she gave into her anger because of Anbey. Yuma forgives Faust, knowing that Faust is a good person. Kyouko and Mami let Faust go, although at the cost of temporarily having their Social Links broken. Faust however restores her link with Kyouko, the red-haired girl already forgiving her because Yuma forgave her.

=== Chitose Yuma ===
{| width="100%"
|[[File:Magia yuma.JPG|250px|right]]

==== Revolution ====
A young orphan under the care of Kyouko. She was tricked into contracting by Oriko, which provoked Kyouko into hunting Oriko and Kirika down.

Upon discovering Kyouko's brutalized corpse after dealing with Oriko and Kirika, Yuma was about to lose it and transform into a witch, if Faust didn't snap out of her own shock and quickly gave Yuma a grief seed and calmed her down, telling her that Kyouko would want her to live on and continue to fight, and that she can't give up. Mami also decides that she will fight and continue to live on in Kyouko's place, and becomes Yuma's new caretaker. 

Yuma is shown to be a very fragile, dependent, and emotional child throughout Revolution, to the point where she seemed almost yandere as she is very prone to brief periods of madness and anger. When Mami was in danger by being killed by a witch during Sayaka's dinner date, she briefly became mad, shouting "NEVER TOUCH MY ONEE-CHAN!" Her madness seemingly made her stronger, as she was successfully able to prevent Mami from dying. After defeating the witch, Kyousuke's ungratefulness and fear of the witches and the magical girls angered Yuma. She almost wanted to tell him off, if she didn't realize that it wouldn't be worth it anyways.  

The day of Walpurgisnacht, Mami and Yuma visit the Sakura Church once last time, before the final battle. There they find what seemingly is the spirit of Kyouko in physical form. Mami and Yuma are shocked, their friend seemingly alive again. Kyouko thanks Mami for taking care of Yuma all this time and embraces the both of them, only to then reveal she is a witch imitating Kyouko's form. The witch then impales the both of them with her tendrils. Mami, fueled with rage again, transforms into her MG form, only for her head to be quickly decapitated and crushed by the witch, sealing her death. Yuma, who now realized she lost both of her Onee-chans, activates her Rage mode, defeating the witch, and almost going completely mad, were it not for Kyouko's spirit and voice calming her down. Luckily for her, Mami and Kyouko are brought back with their memories thanks to Faust breaking causality and merging all timelines into one.

==== Sketch (Alternate Universe) ====

In Sketch, Yuma and Kyouko live together at Sayaka's place. Yuma also deemed both Kyouko and Sayaka as her "mommies." 

==== Rebuild ====

After Faust recovers after the 2nd Witch attack, she along with Kyouko and Yuma decide to hunt for Ayase Souju, who has been hunting other magical girls for their Soul Gems. Although Kyouko and Yuma seemingly have the upper hand on Ayase, her dual Soul Gem personality catches them off-guard, knocking the both of them out. They are however saved by the appearance of Oriko and Kirika, who kill Ayase.

Like her relationship with Kyouko, Yuma also see's Faust as an older sister figure. Yuma loves having piggy-back rides with Faust, and also likes to command Faust to do whatever she wishes, the pink-haired girl always obeying the green loli's orders. In Episode 18, Faust impales Yuma out of uncontrolled anger because of Anbey's words. Yuma however forgives Faust, knowing that deep down, the pink-haired girl is a good person. During the festival, despite what just happened recently, Kyouko forgives Faust because of Yuma, and the spend a little time hanging out and eat some taiyaki. As they eat Yuma says that she is happy that Faust is now happy, to which Faust tearfully thanks the small girl.

=== Shizuki Hitomi ===
{| width="100%"
|[[File:Magia hitomi.jpg|200px|right]]

==== Revolution ====

With Kyousuke isolating himself after the witch incident at the dinner date with Sayaka, and with Madoka and Sayaka seemingly ignoring her and hanging out with Mami and Homura instead, Hitomi has felt nothing but loneliness and neglect throughout Revolution. The potential despair Hitomi held piqued Kyubey's interest, and he decided she was eligible for a contract in episode 15, which was also the day of Walpurgisnacht. Kyubey tells Hitomi that her friends are in danger, and that he can grant her the powers to fight and protect them if she has a wish. Hitomi then wishes to protect everyone she holds dear, and becomes a magical girl.

Hitomi's abilities include having mastery over hand-to-hand fighting with her fists and legs, along with superhuman strength. Hitomi also has the ability to shoot pillars of strong flames from her hands as her primary ranged attack. Complimenting her strong CQC skills is her ability to create powerful barriers that can protect her and those around her. 

At the end of Revolution, Hitomi is friends with Faust and the rest of the girls. She is a bit depressed over Kyousuke isolating himself from her and Sayaka, but Faust tells her that if he doesn't snap out of it, he's just a coward (not worth the effort). 

==== Sketch (Alternate Universe) ====

In Sketch, Hitomi is the one who planned the vacation to the beach. After Faust somehow revives Mazushii (Poorfag) from the dead, Hitomi and Mazushii become close friends.

==== Rebuild ====

Hitomi is still friends with Faust and the rest of the girls, but is still depressed over Kyousuke isolating himself. Faust cheers up Hitomi, saying Sayaka loved him, but  was able to let go of him, and that she should too. She says the violin boy is definitely not worth the effort, and that if she ever needed anything, she and the rest of the girls are here for her. It is then explicitly stated that Hitomi started developing a crush on Faust. Her hopes are seemingly crushed however, when Faust gives a kiss to Mami in episode 7.

In episode 17, it is revealed that Hitomi got together with Kyousuke, being successful at easing the boy's fear of magical girls and witches. Faust doesn't take the news very well, although she accepts it, as long as the green-haired girl is happy.

=== Kyubey ===
{| width="100%"
|[[File:Magia kyubey.jpg|300px|right]]

==== Revolution ====

Kyubey maintains a similar as he did in the anime. Not knowing the existence of Faust, he questions Madoka's motives as to why she willingly let Homura kill him, instead of trying to save him in the first episode. Although he repeatedly tries to contract Madoka and Sayaka throughout Revolution similar to the anime, Faust's efforts prevents Kyubey from accomplishing anything. In fact, Kyubey becomes more like a butt monkey than an actual antagonist in Revolution. In many instances where Faust was in a dangerous situation, she often used Kyubey as distraction. This is especially apparent when Faust gets attacked by Walpurgisnacht's familiars. In combination with her Mind Bomb, Faust used a couple of Kyubey's bodies as a projectile, firing him at mach speed towards the familiars. This technique became known as the Kyubey Bullet. In another instance where Faust falls into a deep chasm inside Walpurgisnacht's clock tower, she uses Kyubey with her Mind Bomb again, this time however as a sort of catapult to launch herself back up. This technique became known as the Kyubeypult or Kyubeyrocket. After Ferocia is defeated, Kyubey tells Faust that Soul Gems no longer become corrupted, which means witches exist no longer, seemingly destroying the Magical Girl System. This is actually retconned in the new Revolution ending redux. The Magical Girl System still remains intact after the defeat of Ferocia. Witches can still exist, although a new type of witch also surfaced in Rebuild from Faust's distortions, the Infernals.

==== Covenant and Sketch (Alternate Universe) ====

In Covenant, Kyubey tries to stop and eliminate Anbey from spreading further chaos with her plans of a world war, as it interferes with his own plan. It is revealed that Kyubey got the Magical Girl System working again, with magical girls becoming human witches instead. 

In Sketch, Kyubey only makes one appearance, attempting to contract Madoka after Homura is killed by human Oktavia. Faust stops him just in time however, and sacrifices her own life to save Homura in Madoka's place. 

==== Rebuild ====

Kyubey's first appearance in Rebuild is similar in Revolution, as once again he is used as a diversion for Faust to avoid getting killed by familiars. After Kyubey tells Faust of Ayase Souju, a rogue magical girl who hunts other MGs and collects their Soul Gems, Faust and Kyubey try to find Mami, Kyouko, and Yuma and warn them about her. During their search, Faust stumbles upon a strange boy who calls himself Randy. Faust immediately notices that Randy LOOKED at Kyubey, and tells Kyubey to follow him and spy on him. Kyubey however comes up with nothing, the boy disappearing without a trace.

After Faust returns back to Mami's aparment upon the defeat of Tamiko, Kyubey reveals to Faust that another Walpurgisnacht is appearing, this time an actual gathering of Witches/Infernals.

=== Mikuni Oriko and Kure Kirika ===
{| width="100%"
[[File:Kirika and Oriko Magia.jpg|250px|right]]

==== Revolution ====

After Faust learns of Oriko and Kirika's presence in this timeline and the magical girl killings, she and the girls decide to hunt the two magical girls. After Homura effortlessly knocks out Kirika with her superior time manipulation, Oriko makes her entrance and fights of Homura, Mami, Kyouko, and Yuma. With her prescience powers, Oriko manages to fend off the four girls for a little while. However, Homura kills Kirika, leaving Oriko shocked and wide open to an attack. Before her execution, Faust assures Oriko that she won't let anything happen to this city, that she wants to protect the people she care about. Oriko realizes what she's done up to this point has been for naught, and that Kirika died meaninglessly. Oriko then accepts her fate as Homura shoots an RPG at her and kills her.

==== Rebuild ====

With Kyouko and Yuma knocked out by Ayase, Faust is left with no means to defend herself. Ayase prepares to kill Faust, only for Kirika to appear out of nowhere and destroy Ayase's two Soul Gems, killing her. Oriko then appears and asks Faust will she not contract. Despite being bewildered at seeing Oriko and Kirika alive again, Faust takes Oriko's offer and joins forces with her. Although she learns that Oriko plans to kill both Madoka and Sayaka to seemingly prevent the end of the world, Faust manages to convince her that she will prevent them from contracting at all costs. One night, while Faust, Madoka, and Sayaka are staying at Mami's apartment while the rest of the girls go witch hunting, Faust detects an Infernal right outside. Oriko and Kirika shows up to rescue them and tells the girls to run away as far as possible while they handle the Infernal. Faust, Madoka, and Sayaka get caught however by Anbey's magical girl minion, Tamiko. Faust becomes stranded in Asunaro City while Madoka and Sayaka remain captive with Anbey. While in Asunaro City, Faust has a vision of Madoka and Sayaka (especially) being brutally tortured by Tamiko and Ayume. In the vision, she witnesses Sayaka die as she maintains many deep cut wounds before being stabbed in the throat, seemingly killing her. However, upon Faust's return to Mitakihara, Sayaka and Madoka are discovered to be fine. This was because of Oriko's prescience powers, saving Madoka and Sayaka before Faust's vision could happen.

=== Kazumi and The Pleiades Saints ===
{| width="100%"
[[File:Mahou shoujo kazumi magica fanart.jpg|300px|right]]

==== Revolution ====

Kazumi along with the Pleiades Saints makes their first appearance in episode 18, after learning the source of the familiars all around the world came from Walpurgisnacht at Mitakihara. Although Kazumi is friendly with Faust and the girls, the rest of the Pleiades Saints at don't cooperate with Faust at first, but eventually accept after it's apparent they themselves cannot defeat the super witch. Upon Walpurgisnacht's defeat, the Pleiades Saints returned to Asunaro City. 

==== Rebuild ====

Upon being stranded in Asunaro City and gaining her new powers, Faust decides to look for Kazumi, the only trustworthy Pleiades Saint, for help. She stumbles upon the other Pleiades Saints, who are about to take another magical girl's Soul Gem. Faust manages to stop them, and after briefly lecturing them on their extreme, but good intentions, with force and OBJECTION, she manages them to temporarily get them on her side. Kaoru then takes Faust to Kazumi's place for the night. The next morning, Faust has breakfast with Kazumi, Umika, and Kaoru. Upon witnessing Faust chow down her breakfast with absolute disregard for table manners, Kazumi knows that Faust is a trustworthy person, which Umika and Kaoru eventually accepts. The three Saints then accompany Faust on her trip back to Mitakihara on Saki's order's to help the long pink-haired girl with Madoka and Sayaka. 

In episode 12, Kazumi, Kaoru, and Umika are the first to ever hear of Faust talking about her past. They learn of Faust's severe memory loss, how she desperately tries to maintain those memories, the girls the only thing she has in this world to protect. Despite not knowing Faust for long, the three girls sympathize with Faust and embrace her. Kaoru tells Faust the truth of their orders as to why they came with her to Mitakihara, and says she doesn't want to fight her. She asks Faust if she would join the Pleiades Saints, to which Faust declines but insists that they spend as much time together in the present and forget about fighting. Meanwhile, in Hitomi's point of view, she is attacked by the other Saints, she being the next girl to be placed in the Freezer. Oriko and Kirika however intervene, save Hitomi, and drive off the Saints.

After Faust defeats Tamiko in episode 13 with her Pseudo-Witch Barrier power, the Pleiades Saints excluding Kazumi appear and confront Faust, ready to attack her. Before she attacks herself, Faust asks the Saints why they fight. Saki answers straight, to fight the system filled with contradictions, but it's clear she doesn't want to fight Faust. Umika and Kaoru also say the same, but proclaim they cannot fight Faust. Saki, not willing to fight against her teammates, let's Faust go, gives her a Grief Seed, and leaves with the other Saints, with Umika and Kaoru remaining with Faust.

== Summaries ==

=== Revolution ===

One day, you wake up in Madoka's body, at the beginning of TL5. You have no memories of yourself, only knowing the events of the anime. You don't even know your own name. You eventually decide that you will try to change this future, and save the girls no matter what. You reveal to Homura your knowledge of the events, gaining her trust. With her by your side, you were able to work together with Mami peacefully and prevent her death in episode 3 of the anime. You also had Mami heal Kyousuke' hand to prevent Sayaka from contracting. You also were able to meet and communicate with Madoka within yourself, reveal everything to her, and let her entrust you with handling everything. She ask what is your name, with which you name yourself Faust. Faust's mind eventually merges with Madoka, making them one complete being. All was going well, but nothing is ever so simple. Kyouko makes her appearance along with Yuma and warns Faust of the magical girl killings going around town. 

Faust already knew the killings were caused by Oriko and Kirika, so she gathers the girls and hunts for the two killers. She finds the two magical girls in a witch barrier, and although with the help of her friends she defeats and kill the two girls, Kyouko gets killed by the witch. Despite the sudden and tragic death, Faust saves Yuma from despairing, and still resolves to save this timeline. Fast forward just a couple days before Walpurgisnacht. Faust and Homura has planned and prepared for weeks, and decide to spend the remaining time relaxing with the other girls. Yet, relaxing is one thing fate will never grant. Mami is killed by a witch that impersonated Kyouko. Walpurgisnacht appears, but is MUCH stronger than the one even from the anime. In fact, all the witches Faust faced were more powerful than their anime counterparts, and even her friends were stronger than normal. She then realize all of this is because of herself. 

Throughout the story, Faust discovers she has mind powers, and is the very reason why she is in Madoka's body in the first place: she leaped into her mind. As she struggled and fought, her mind powers developed and became stronger and stronger. However, those very powers were affecting the Madokaverse itself, creating distortions that made both witches and magical girls far stronger. Her powers became ridiculous to the point that as she and the others made their way to Walpurgisnacht, Faust accidentally sends everyone to TL3, witnessing Mami about to kill everyone after her Sayaka turned into a witch. Faust manages to stop her, and she convinces her and the other girls of this timeline to help the fight against Walpurgis. With Faust's powers, she then transport everyone back to your original timeline, with TL3 Mami and Kyouko gaining the memories of this timeline. With their help, along with the help of the Pleiades Saints, they distract Walpurgisnacht long enough for Faust to get close and erase her from existence with your own mind. The battle wasn't over however. Erasing Walpurgis suddenly pulled her into another dimension where she meets and fights the ultimate witch, Ferocia, witch of Causality. Temporarily, Faust was able to access the powers of her friends from the bonds she forged with them, using them and ultimately defeating Ferocia. Faust returns to Mitakihara, the world seemingly saved. Suddenly, she and Madoka separate and Faust acquires her own body in the form of Madoka's Goddess alter-ego. Although Faust lost the majority of her mind powers and the Puella Magi System remained intact and continued to exist, with the threat of Walpurgisnacht gone, she decides to live the rest of her new life peacefully with the friends she made.

=== Rebuild ===

It's been a couple weeks since the events of Revolution took place. Faust dreams of a terrifying witch attacking the town, the witch seemingly being herself. She wakes up, just passing it off as another nightmare. Faust continues to live her life with the girls, Mami being her roommate. It was Faust's first day of school today, and it continued like any other day, although Homura was acting very strange and distant towards her. Suddenly, Faust's eyes turned crimson red, detecting a witch. She runs outside the school to discover a witch without a barrier, which she names an Infernal. She immediately realizes the Infernals were of her doings, being created by the distortions set from her mind powers. These witches were born from a mixture of rage and grief, and don't use barriers to hide, preferring to attack anything in sight. Faust tries to handle the Infernal herself, wanting to gain independence and stop relying on the other girls. However, the loss of most of her mind powers restricted her from doing anything useful, and she was forced to be saved by Hitomi.

Being injured from the witch, Faust decide to stay home for the day, but her restlessness caused her to go out. She is attacked by a regular Witch, and still Faust is not able to do anything to help herself. She is barely saved by Mami, and falling ill due to seeing illusions, Faust stays back at home for the rest of the day. Before the day ends, Faust is notified by Kyubey that Ayase Souju is present in the city and is hunting magical girls. The next day, with Kyouko and Yuma's help, Faust decides to hunt for Ayase. Upon finding her, Kyouko and Yuma fight her and seemingly have the advantage, until Ayase reveals her dual Soul Gem personality and manages to knock out the two girls. The girl is ready to kill Faust until suddenly, Oriko and Kirika arrive and save her, killing Ayase. Oriko offers to work with Faust, remembering the words she spoke to her in Revolution. Despite her shock in seeing her alive again, Faust accepts her proposal. Oriko reveals her plan to kill Madoka and Sayaka, possibly seeing a future of them turning into immensely powerful witches. Faust convinces her to do otherwise, promising she will prevent them from contracting from all costs. 

That night, Faust, Madoka and Sayaka stay at Mami's place while the other girls go Witch hunting when another Infernal appears outside the apartment. She and the two girls attempt to escape with the help of Oriko and Kirika, however, they are stopped and kidnapped by a mysterious magical girl named Tamiko. Faust briefly meets another magical girl named Ayume, and a sinister Incubator with emotions named Anbey before she is knocked out and left stranded in Asunaro City.

While in Asunaro City, Faust dreams of that same church you dreamed of back in Revolution. There she meets a mysterious girl who gives her the option of accepting new powers for the cost of her old ones, allowing her to "lose everything, and gain all." Faust accepts, growing frustrated with her inability to accomplish anything. The powers she gained are strengthened from the bonds she forged with her friends and will continue to grow stronger the deeper her bonds with them are. With her new powers, Faust decides to find Kazumi, the only trustworthy Pleiades Saint, to help her. Along the way, she meets the other Saints, and uses her powers to prevent them from kidnapping a magical girl, her confidence being restored. With some lecturing, Faust temporarily gets them on her side, and she stays at Kazumi's place for the night with Kaoru and Umika. The next morning, Faust returns to Mitakihara along with the three Saints, their orders being to help her with Madoka and Sayaka.

Upon returning, Faust discovers that Oriko and Kirika rescued Madoka and Sayaka, saving them before Sayaka dies from a vision she foresaw in Asunaro City. After speaking with the two girls, Faust confronts Homura, who's been harboring resentment towards her ever since the beginning. Faust learns that Homura believes she ruined everything, knowing that she is the source of all the problems. About to give up and turn into a Witch, Faust saves her once again, and brings her back into the light, restoring her relationship with Homura. Suddenly, a Soul Gem bursts from Faust's chest, revealing that she is a magical girl, and that the mysterious girl who gave her her powers was really Anbey. 

Becoming worried about the recent turn of events, Faust goes out and looks for Hitomi with the three Saints, who went missing after she returned. While looking for the green-haired girl, Faust opens up to the Saints, revealing that she has memory loss and can only retain her memory for a couple of days. The only way for her to remember is to keep entries logged in a journal she's been writing in between the events of Revolution and Rebuild. The three girls sympathize with her, and Kaoru reveals the true intent of the Saints and asks Faust to join the Saints, to avoid fighting. Faust refuses, and insist that they spend what time they have left together. Suddenly, Faust detects a Witch and an Infernal, and she decides to take on the Infernal while the Saints deal with the Witch.

With her new powers, Faust defeats the Infernal with ease, and decides to find the Saints to back them up. Upon locating the witch, she stumbles upon Tamiko once again and fights her. Tamiko proved to be no match for Faust, as she reveals her power to create a Pseudo-Witch Barrier. All the Saints save Kazumi then confront Faust, ready to fight her. Kaoru and Umika manage to prevent it, the two girls have no intent on fighting Faust. After the rest of the Saints leave, Tamiko, who was cut in half and seemingly unconscious, unexpectedly attacks the three of them, stabbing Umika in the throat and crushing Kaoru's Soul Gem. Thankfully, however, Faust manages to use her powers to rewind time back to one minute, and kill Tamiko, preventing the other two from dying.

After burying the corpse of Tamiko, the three girls return back to Mami's apartment, where Faust meets Oriko and Kirika once again and learns that they saved Hitomi earlier from an attack by the Saints. Although she knows that Faust contracted, Oriko continues to work with her, unwilling to fight Faust and wanting to help her save this world. Kyubey appears, and notifies Faust of an event happening soon, Walpurgisnacht. Baffled, Faust angrily demands how is Walpurgisnacht appearing again, to which Kyubey responds its a different one. This Walpurgisnacht is literally a gathering of witches, Infernal Witches to be exact. This sudden turn of events shocks Faust, and makes her question whether everything she's done up to this point has really helped anything. 

While trying to process everything that has been revealed to her, Anbey makes his appearance again and tells Faust how he contracted her for energy and for his sole entertainment. He also reveals that Jubey is working on the creation of the new Walpurgisnacht, the Freezer and Kazumi being the host. In order to stop it's birth, both Kazumi and the Soul Gems must be destroyed. 

The next day, Faust along with Kyouko, Yuma, and Madoka go witch hunting, while the rest of the girls at Mami's apartment discuss about Walpurgisnacht. After defeating the witch and having a short bonding moment with Yuma, Faust decides to stay at Madoka's place for the night before the school festival tomorrow. During her stay, Faust finds and reads Madoka's campus notebook, that reveal that Madoka, despite everything Faust and Homura has said to her, has remained the same, blaming herself for her uselessness and wishing she could contract so she could help somehow. While taking a bath together, Madoka embraces Faust in tears, revealing her feelings about her own uselessness. Faust tells Madoka that she will do everything in Madoka's stead, and reveals about her memory loss and her theory that she will disappear once her memories fade entirely. Faust assures Madoka that she won't disappear until she knows she made the world a better place for everyone, but Madoka can't help but cry, not wanting the twin sister she loved to disappear. Madoka asks what she can do, to which Faust replies that just living and breathing is enough for her and everyone else. Madoka, realizing Faust's words, and thanks Faust, the bond between them maxed and unbreakable.

It's early morning and the festival has already started. After leaving the Kaname residence, Faust and Mami, along with Kazumi, Kaoru, and Umika decide to take a peek at the festivities. While they check things out, Mami reveals to everyone that Madoka told her that Faust will disappear. Although the girls were worried, Faust brushes it off, saying she will be fine. Kazumi and the two Saints then leave Mami and Faust alone, continuing to enjoy the festivities. Faust and Mami decide to head back home to get ready for the night festivities. While they eat some breakfast together, Faust ask's Mami's opinion of herself, to which Mami says that she's a close friend, and that they kissed. The blond reveals that while she would be ready to have a relationship with Faust, she can't go through it. Mami loves Faust, for keeping her company as her roommate, after being alone for so long. Because Mami knows Faust is going to disappear eventually someday, she doesn't want to be together with Faust. Despite that, she doesn't want Faust to disappear, the one person who's always been by her side. Faust assures her that even though she will vanish, she will live her life for the blond and all the other girls, because magical girls bring hope. Mami realizes Faust's words and embraces her, sorry for what she said and glad that she got to meet Faust.

After finally getting dressed for the festival, with still three hours of time left to spare before everyone meets up, Faust and Mami decide to go and hang at Sayaka's place for awhile. While on the way, the two girls meet Kyouko and Yuma at the Sakura Church, and Faust convinces Kyouko to go to the festival for Sayaka. Before making their way to Sayaka's place, Faust is interrupted by Anbey yet again. Faust decides to talk to the black Incubator, to see if he has anything useful to say. Anbey then reveals information that seems to contradict his previous statements: Faust is actually the host for Walpurgisnacht. He also reveals that Ayume, one of his underlings, is also a cultivated magical girl just like Faust. Anbey plans on defeating Jubey's Walpurgisnacht with Ayume, then letting Ayume turn witch for even more energy. Anbey then reveals one last kicker that pushes Faust over the curve: that her abilities are actually draining the magic and lifeforce from her friends. Whether anything Anbey said was truth is not certain, but Faust couldn't take the reveal and goes into an uncontrolled Rage Mode.

Filled with bloodlust, Faust wants to hunt down and kill Ayume, but because she has no idea where she is, she decides to kill the nearest target, Yuma. Faust manages to impale Yuma, but she is ultimately stopped and defeated by Mami and Kyouko. Regaining her sanity, Faust tells the two girls the truth as to why she went out of control, the black Incubator manipulating her emotions. Yuma, who healed herself from Faust's attack, believes Faust and forgives her, knowing that deep down, the pink-haired girl is a good person. Mami and Kyouko let Faust go, although temporarily, the bonds they share with Faust are broken. Faust then wanders aimlessly before the festival, thinking about what she just did. While she sits at a bench, Anbey speaks to her once again, although with a completely different personality. Sitting quietly, Faust listens as Anbey talks about how he nothing can stop Faust, and how he finds the human race amazing because of their soul and spirit. Whether this side of Anbey is genuine, or is just another way to confuse Faust, is not entirely certain.

Faust finally heads to the festival, wanting to celebrate despite what happened earlier. She meets Kyouko and Yuma who are together with Sayaka and decides to spend some time with them. Kyouko tells Faust that she already forgave her when Yuma did, their bond being restored. After spending some time with the three girls, Faust looks for Mami, finding her on the roof. The blond also forgives Faust, and they spend some time hanging out with Oriko and Kirika and then practicing their routine for a dance competition.

The PoV is then switched to Madoka's perspective. Madoka and Homura go together to the festival. As Madoka searches for Faust, she gets a phone call from Mami, telling her to find a safe place. Confused, Madoka asks what she's talking about, until suddenly, Ayume, who is under Anbey's control, attacks the two girls. Homura tries to cover Madoka, but both of the girls end up getting stabbed by the onslaught of rapiers. Just when Madoka was about to die, Faust rewinds time and manages to prevent the two girl's deaths, then engages Ayume. After meeting up with Mami and finding a safe place to hide, Madoka tells Homura to go help Faust. Even though the psychopathic girl contained 13 Soul Gems and also possessed a Reality Marble, Faust together with the help of Homura easily defeats and kills Ayume. Upon defeating Ayume, Anbey appears, and after an exchange of words, Faust figures out that the black Incubator is planning to overthrow his own race. 

Although Ayume, who was apparently a host for Walpurgisnacht, was defeated, Anbey still proclaims he is always a step ahead of Faust. After the Incubator is shot dead by Homura, Faust falls down exhausted, realizing that the magic she used in the fight was draining the time left in her body, and that she will disappear tonight. While Oriko and Madoka go to Mami's apartment to fetch Faust's journal, Faust spends the rest of her remaining time with the other girls on the school roof. However, after noticing that Oriko and Madoka haven't come back, she rushes to find them, locating them trapped inside a Witch Barrier. With her powers, Faust saves the two girls and defeats the Witch easily. The use of her powers however took a greater toll on her body, and made her realize that she won't just disappear, she will turn into a Witch before she vanishes entirely. Homura attempts to do a Time Rest, being pained by seeing Faust, who is essentially Madoka, turning into a Witch right in front of her very eyes, like previous timelines. Faust manages to convince her to stay, saying she already saved Madoka, and that she isn't alone anymore. Faust then experiences great pain, her Soul Gem about to burst into a Grief Seed and form a Witch. Despite all odds, Faust manages to maintain herself, and calls Anbey to talk to him. Faust then uses the Team Mimic ability to her advantage on Anbey, regenerating her body's lifeforce. Faust then tells the other girls she won't disappear, seemingly averting her death. However, after an unspecified amount of time, Faust finds herself in Starcrossed Place, her being alive or dead uncertain.

Episode 22 reveals that the end of episode 21 was all an illusion. Faust takes a last journey to Starcrossed Place moments before her death, speaking to unknown voice. She despairs after answering the voice's question, her Soul Gem bursting into a Grief Seed and giving birth to the Witch of Infinity. The PoV is then switched to Madoka. With the help of Homura, the two girls manages to escape from Faust's barrier for the time being. Madoka asks Anbey what are his motivations and intentions, telling her it is exactly what just happened, turning Faust into a witch. According to him, the Witch of Infinity contains the same properties as Walpurgisnacht and will produce a "Domino Effect." Madoka wants to know if there's any way of saving Faust, in which Anbey replies that she shouldn't try unless she wants to die. Curious as to why Anbey cares about her being, Madoka asks why he wants her to stay alive, in which Anbey reveals that she inherited the burden of Faust. Kyubey then tells her specifically that she contains two souls, one of them being Faust's soul. This is because when Faust initially separated from Madoka in Revolution, while most of her soul moved into her new body, a small portion of her soul remained in Madoka, establishing the connection between them. However, since the "Faust" the girls know is dead, Madoka cannot communicate with Faust's soul. Rather, it has completely merged with her. Upon learning this revelation, Madoka decides to confront Faust's witch, the future that lay before her uncertain.

=== Tower of Baal ===

The story starts with a conversation between an old man and a young blond girl. The girl named Marisa Kirisame and the old man Yasuo Kachibana exchange some small talk before the book in the old man's hand starts glowing, signaling the start of a war. A war fought with nine warriors and nine magical weapons. Other warriors brought from other worlds, fighting with their Master just for this one purpose. A war where there's only one survivor and that survivor gets their wishes fulfilled by that Tower. That Tower that looms in the sky once only three fighters remain. Is it a curse on the world or is it a gift? Countless people have told stories of the Tower's past, saying that it's a blessing. Saying it can save everyone and everything if someone is victorious. No one has thought to destroy the tower because it's a comfort to them. Every century they bask in the glory of the ivory tower.

The story then assumes the PoV of Takeru Shinozaki, the main protagonist. The Tower war about to start, he ignores his little sister and prepares to summon his familiar for the battle. Using Nebra as his contract weapon, he summons Sakuya Izayoi, albeit an incomplete summoning. Sakuya, who was summoned without the rules of the war already in her knowledge, is confused by her sudden surroundings and almost kills Takeru out of frustration and anger. Eventually, Takeru convinces her to fight with her in the war, promising her to return her back to her home once the war is over. However, the relationship between them starts off very shaky, Sakuya distrustful and distant to Takeru. 

Both Takeru and Sakuya then immediately start exploring the city to find other Masters and Familiars. They meet and fight Marisa and Yasuo. During the intense fight, Yasuo reveals his identify and also reveals how he was a participant in the previous Tower war. Yasuo then asks to call the fight a draw and leave each other for the night, to which Takeru agrees.

The next day, Takeru decides to bring Sakuya to school, in case if he gets attacked during the day. While they walk to school, they talk of various things, about the battle last night, and how danmaku bullets are now lethal in this world. Using Nebra's illusions, Sakuya watches Takeru in class while invisible, and the day goes by peacefully. As they walk back home, Takeru notices a strange cat (Chen) sitting upon a tree, watching him. He tells Sakuya of this telepathically, but she tells him to ignore it, and they proceed to head home.

After an hour of debating and planning, Takeru and Sakuya decide to go scouting again for the night to see if they can locate other Masters and Familiars. They decide to check out Takeru's school, in which Takeru senses a massive fluctuation of Natural Magic. He realizes that there is a summoning about to happen in the school, and although he decides not to interrupt it, Sakuya decides to head inside the school and interrupt it herself. While chasing her, Takeru sees many bloodied corpses around the school, in which he realizes Tyfring, The Sword of Bonded Curse, is being used to summon a familiar. After retreating into the open field with Sakuya, Sayaka appears as the familiar of the weapon, having turned insane from the weapon's curse. While Sakuya takes care of Sayaka, Takeru decides to go back inside the school to search for Sayaka's master. Takeru finds Sayaka's master and attempts to use a sneak attack on her with Nebra's illusions, although it fails. The two masters battle, and while Takeru seemingly had the advantage and was about to inflict a killing blow, Sayaka's master manages to surprise him and stab him back, revealing how Tyfring makes the souls of the Master and Familiar connected, making them one. Realizing he couldn't win this battle, he retreats along with Sakuya and attempts to escape, the insane master and familiar still hot on their trails. They fly into a roof of a building, and manage to escape from the insane duo for now. While treating Takeru's wound, Sakuya immediately senses another familiar watching them, and forces her to come out. Homura then appears, and reveals that she wants help against Sayaka. The three then agree to bring Takeru back home safely, Homura watching from afar. As they walk home, Takeru thanks Sakuya in his sleep, exhausted from the battle. Sakuya smiles, slowly opening up to Takeru. 

The next day, after having some small talk of Sakuya's home, the two sees news of the murdered students on television. Takeru and Sakuya decide to investigate the school again to see if they can locate Sayaka and her master. They find a magical seal within the school and break it, revealing a stairway to a basement, drops a blood falling upon each step. They walk down the bloodied stairway, till suddenly the stairs break and collapse and a single azure light approaches them in complete darkness. Takeru and Sakuya attempt to escape by flying, but the light was too fast for them, and Takeru finds himself collapsed on the bottom of the stairway, his waist now non-existent from the attack. With only moments left to live, he calls for Sakuya through telepathy, the maid still alive, but with blood flowing down her arm. A boy with brown hair, a black hoodie, and with his hands in his pocket, then reveals himself to be the source of the attack.

== Backstory ==
===Third Axis: Rage ===
Due to Faust's distortions in the universe, a third function was 'hacked' into the Soul Gem. Now, when a Puella Magi experiences intense fluctuations of rage, their magical capacity increases. This offers a boost in combat. However, reliance on this power can prove to be quite dangerous. Both Grief and Rage can coexist in the Soul Gem, making for catastrophic results. It can cause a large explosion, consuming the entire surrounding area. An overflow of Rage can cause something covered down below.

===Infernal Witches/Infernal ===
An Infernal is a Puella Magi that has been consumed by Rage. The Soul Gem becomes a bright red before becoming a dark brown. The Soul Gem explodes, causing the body of the original Puella Magi to disintegrate in the blast. The nature of an Infernal Witch is far different than that of a regular witch. Instead of hiding in a barrier, Infernal's will directly attack their targets. They aren't afraid of Puellae Magi and have no interest in hiding. They're a physical manifestation of the Puella Magi's hate for the world. Their behavior is linked to the source of their Rage. For instance, if Homura transformed she would destroy everything but Madoka. Anything that would cause the girl sadness, she would obliterate it without remorse.

===Ferocia===
Witch of Causality

Nature: To Balance

Ferocia is a witch that was given life after the erasing of Walpurgisnacht. Ferocia is essentially a super powerful Walpurgisnacht caused by Faust's distortions in the timeline. Upon being erased, Walpurgisnacht was sent to another plane of existence outside the bounds of reality. Faust fell victim to her own distortions, being teleported to the same plane. Due to the fact that Faust's fears gave birth to this monstrous distortion, it's her responsibility to defeat it. All of Faust's activity in the Madokaverse was balanced out by the birth of Ferocia. The despair caused by Faust's distortions take the form of Grief Seeds that pile into the witch, strengthening it to the point of some kind of god. Ferocia has properites of witches that were born, are born, and are going to be born from all timelines, creating the strongest being in existence.

===Witch of Infinity===

Nature: To Wonder

A witch born from the wishes that never came to be, and the struggle that amounted to nothing.
