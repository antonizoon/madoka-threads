{{Note|For terms commonly used within threads, see '''[[Thread Glossary]]'''.|margin-right:327px}}

This page links to all the Madoka-related threads on the /a/, /jp/, and /tg/ boards on 4Chan.org that have been archived on foolz.us (formerly archived on easymodo.net, and before that green-oval.net). A /sci/ thread is archived on installgentoo.net and /co/ on no-ip.org. Some /tg/ threads are archived in suptg. You will find here the general threads ("Madoka Threads"), as well as humorous, informative or just non-general threads that have a relation with the Puella Magi franchise.

Please note that the image packs have moved and are now in their own section of the [[Fanworks]] page.

Since 28th December 2011 also threads on the /u/ board are archived on archive.foolz.us.

== Pre-season Threads ==
These threads should be added for the sake of completeness, even though no serious discussion could have happened at the time. 
Please add more as they are dug out of the archive.

== Non-general threads ==

These are threads somehow related to Madoka, but that are not part of the general threads chain.

=== Puella Magi /a/nonymous Magica  ===
Set during the main timeline of the anime, what would happen if you were to one day wake up as Madoka Kaname, with knowledge of the events of the anime? What would happen when you let the anonymous folks at /a/ of 4chan take control over Madoka's body? That is the premise of this series of Choose Your Own Adventure threads from /a/. This is the story of the collective conscious of /a/ in Madoka's body, and their fate.

== Starting a new thread ==
[[File:Magia Anime Cover.jpg|thumb|The image used to find threads]]
{{Note|In the event two or more threads are created simultaneously, please only use ''the first one whose link was posted in the old thread''. This way, it should be easier to follow the threads and archive them.|margin-right:207px;}}
The original post of a new thread should contain:
;A link to the previous thread
:For easier navigation between threads, useful at the beginning of the new one
;A link to the wiki
:Because people are bound to ask for it anyway
;A mention of the IRC channel #madoka @ irc.rizon.net
:Having some real-time communication doesn't hurt.
;On Thursday
:Add some information about the broadcast (ETA, channel, livestreams, ... for example)
;Put "Madoka Thread" in the subject line
:So that haters can filter us
;A madoka-related image
:But not necessarily a 'madoka thread' image macro
;Final task
:Return to the previous thread and link to the new one to prevent excess threads from being created. Or even better: warn people in the previous thread beforehand so that thay don't create one themselves.

Aside from that, when the old thread dies, the following image should be posted, so that the thread can be found more easily (to find a Madoka thread, post the fish image and go where the error links you)
