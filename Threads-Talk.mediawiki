== IRC ==

Should we add the IRC (#madoka on irc.rizon.net) to every Madoka Thread as well as the Wiki by default? [[User:Calibre|Calibre]] 11:48, 22 January 2011 (CST)
:I agree with this. [[User:Commie|Commie]] 11:51, 22 January 2011 (CST)
::I'll just go ahead and add it, seeing how it's mentioned on the main page already.[[User:Calibre|Calibre]] 14:01, 22 January 2011 (CST)

== Image Packs ==
I see what you did there, moving the image pack to Threads, but, then I noticed there was a Media section, and it all got a bit confusing. --[[User:Sayaka|Sayaka]] 01:44, 23 January 2011 (CST)
:Image macros in this page is about stuff that is strictly /a/-related (e.g. thread finder, meme, etc.). The one in Media is more general. Since image pack is mostly picked up from /a/, I thought it might better fit here. --[[User:0x99|0x99]] 03:41, 23 January 2011 (CST)

It's been discussed in the threads this morning but no real consensus has been reached, so: instead of having one big archive split in 5 parts or so, wouldn't it be more useful to have a standalone archive per category? (or at least separate NSFW from the rest as mentionned before). This way people can grab just the parts they want (e.g. the wallpapers or the reaction pics), and Archive-kun won't have to reupload the whole thing every time, just the categories that have changed. --[[User:Homerun-chan|Homerun-chan]] 17:25, 12 February 2011 (CST)
:Little correction to what I just said: I just noticed these are now standalone archives, and not one big archive split in parts. Anyway, the content of the archives don't seem very consistent (like, having the 'fanart' folder spanning in two separate archives), so my question still holds --[[User:Homerun-chan|Homerun-chan]] 17:28, 12 February 2011 (CST)

== 'Image macros' section ==

Is that section really useful now that we have the image pack just below? I think we should remove it. --[[User:Homerun-chan|Homerun-chan]] 05:08, 19 February 2011 (CST)
:I agreed it should be removed. Most of them are not used anywhere else in this wiki anyway. --[[User:0x99|0x99]] 10:06, 19 February 2011 (CST)

==[[Pre-season threads]]==
Wait, why don't we just create a new section inside [[Threads]] instead of creating a new page? --[[User:0x99|0x99]] 08:31, 29 January 2011 (CST)

== /u/ madoka general ==

Why aren't the /u/ general threads also archived?  After all, shipping is SRSBS. [[User:Prima|Prima]] 11:33, 8 February 2011 (CST)
:Main reason was because I don't lurk /u/ and /u/sers seem to be lazy. Technical reason is because /u/ isn't archived on green-oval.--[[User:Homerun-chan|Homerun-chan]] 05:07, 19 February 2011 (CST)

== Emergency, general threads splitting like mad post-Episode 8 ==

Rome has fallen!  The empire is dead!  All hope is lost!

Not sure how to handle it at the moment, so I'll just keep track of madoka related threads here:

[[User:Prima|Prima]] 14:01, 25 February 2011 (UCT)

:Okay.   We have a proper topic at >>46391304 now.  Unless someone objects, I trimed the parallel threads down to the three major ones >>46385237, >>46373134, and >>46387005.  Since all three are likely to reach bump limit concurrently, they'll be labeled 240-B,-C,-D.  >>46391304 will be labeled #241.  Hopefully this resolves the issue. [[User:Prima|Prima]] 14:14, 25 February 2011 (UCT)
::If any of the other aforementionned threads are worth reading, don't hesitate to either add them to the 'non-general' list.

== Subgroups comparison copypasta ==

A ... "recurrent subject" in the threads being "who's the best subs group?", here's the usual copypasta for easier reference (not that it won't still cause a 2000-post-long group war anyway, but at least one post would be constructive)

<pre>
[Nutbladder]
http://www.onezerotwo.net

- Speed: Fastest release (Evening after broadcast.)
- TL: Adequate, infrequent but notable errors.
- Style: Honorifics omitted. Typos not uncommon. Emphasizes plain English: not as colorful as gg but not as rigid as yesy.
- Files: Averages the lowest sizes (300~400MB), occasional commercials. Bonus rune font subtitle track since 3.
- Errata: Updated scripts available on their website. Rune sub track bug in 8/9, manual switch to Eng. may be required.

[gg]
http://www.ggkthx.org

- Speed: Typically, a close second after NB.
- TL: Adequate, with notable lapses (such as 2) due to staff issues.
- Style: Honorifics and insert song karaoke omitted. Emphasizes creative, natural-sounding English. Uses "Puella Magi" instead of "magical girl", in concordance with the title.
- Files: Largest sizes, hovering around 500MB. Regularly includes commercials, "colorful" chapter naming.
- Errata: Updated scripts available on their website.

[MahouShoujo+yesy]
http://yesy-fansubs.net/

- Speed: Initial wait for release is late night Thursday or early morning Friday at the earliest, but will often take several days.
- TL: Good. Specifically solicits TL Q&A (although all groups have open blog commenting).
- Style: Strives to remain close to the original meaning, which often results in accurate but rather awkwardly constructed sentences. Honorifics are left in.
- Files: First releases "x264" version, followed later by "ts" version with better raw. Sizes vary, but typically fall in the middle.

[Chihiro]
http://www.chihiro-subs.com/

- Speed: Slowest releases, often one or two weeks or more.
- TL: Generally regarded to be rather poor.
- Style: Leaves honorifics in.
- Files: Average 720p file size (390~440MB), but the only group to also offer 480p alternative.

== Kyuubey takes all that I love away from me ==

*48533277
*48543833 (Let's identify all the historical mahou shoujos)

Since as expected, madoka spilled all over the board(s), I propose we work like that:
* Live-watching, pre-live watching and reaction threads are tagged as such, and added in the general chain (it's been the case already)
* Long enough threads (those that went past bump limit e.g.) are considered generals and tagged as such
* Shorter threads and/or humoristic threads are considered non-generals and belong to the second section
* All other threads (short-lived threads that don't have a particular interrest) are just kept here, but don't move to the main page
* The numbering doesn't really matter. Let's say we order them by thread ID, that seems the most consistent.
Does it sound right to you?<br>
Also, I'll be pretty busy these next few days so I let the archiving in your hands guys. As said above I don't think archiving every madoka thread at this point is relevant; just keep the longest/most interresting ones. --[[User:Homerun-chan|Homerun-chan]] 07:57, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
:I don't think it's possible to document even a sizable portion of threads at this point. [[User:Prima|Prima]] 05:40, 23 April 2011 (UTC)

== Foldable lists ==

Is there a way to make foldable lists, like in wikipedia, and if so, don't you think we should make one per episode?<br>

== Threads in more than one category? ==

http://archive.easymodo.net/a/thread/54348079 in

1. Characters Generals:
Seyiku why

2. Uncategorized:
Why do humans have such a problem with where their souls end up?


Just wanted to point that out.

==The archive didn't have enough grief seeds==
Easymodo was taken down and the database is available for download there. Depsite "This happens every other month", it sounds more realistic this time, and foolz is starting up a new archive. I'm planning to switch the thread links over to it. /tg/ will go to suptg, if all the relevant threads turn out to be on it. Also, if one of you has the resources, now is the time to back up the archive database just in case. It'll only be up on easymodo for about a week. When/if a torrent of it appears, point it out here. I'd do it myself but low upload residential dsl kind of defeats the purpose. [[User:KM|KM]] 01:01, 31 October 2011 (UTC)

== Kyouko threads in a separate category? ==

So, uh, seeing how Kyouko threads (usually started by Kyoubro) are becoming a relatively regular thing on /a/ and they're timed so they don't fly right into the spammer's times, I've been thinking maybe all Kyouko threads should get their own category, at least.

On the other hand, the current thread list related to characters is beyond huge already. Maybe we should just give each character their own section by now?

Personally, I'm in favor of categorizing all characters separately for the main cast, and if some madman makes a Hitomi or Kazumi thread, they get filed under "misc" and done. [[User:CuleX|CuleX]] 07:42, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
:I see no problem with this. Categorizing each of the main girls would make the character threads easier to browse. --[[User:Riga92|Riga92]] 07:43, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
